# EnableX Click2Call Application: Simplify Voice Communication with Dialer SDK for Real-Time Calls
EnableX Click2Call Application: Seamlessly Connect Callers and Callees to Virtual Rooms

EnableX offers a robust Click2Call application designed to facilitate the connection between callers and callees within a Virtual Room hosted on the EnableX server. This communication is achieved through the Dialer SDK, which serves as a vital wrapper/library, leveraging Socket events for smooth interaction.

The Dialer SDK acts as a bridge connecting the client application with Click2Call, enabling efficient provisioning of voice calls in EnableX rooms. Consequently, the Dialer SDK becomes the primary interface for integrating EnableX voice services into your client application. With Dialer SDK, the client application can effortlessly execute various tasks, including:

1. Initiating outbound calls.
2. Accepting or rejecting inbound calls.
3. Disconnecting ongoing calls.
4. Canceling outgoing calls.
5. Holding or resuming calls.

This comprehensive integration enhances your application's capabilities and ensures a seamless voice communication experience for your users.
